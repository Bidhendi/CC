The accompanying script is tested under Python 2.7.1 and was developed to acquire data from a 
VINT HUB (ID: HUB000_0, Phidgets) interfacing a load cell and a position sensor to the 
computer via a USB cable. The script plots the forces and displacements (by putting the signal data in line equations)
in real time on screen and saves them in an Excel file for further analysis. For more information please refer to:
